# What is this?
This is an algorithm to detect wet dog shakes (a.k.a. head twitches) in rodents using accelerometer signals. Wet dog shakes are commonly used in neuroscience research to investigate activation of the 5HT2A receptor.

# Documentation
Please see the script [demo.m](https://github.com/NRC-Lund/wdsdetector/blob/main/demo.m) for an example on how to use the detector. More information can be found in the paper XXX.

# Dependencies
The algorithm is written in Matlab. It requires the Signal Processing Toolbox.

# Installation
Make sure that the folder `+wdsdetecor` is on the Matlab path.

# Reference
